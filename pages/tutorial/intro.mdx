# Intro

This is where the instructions would appear, written
in mdx so you can use:
 
titles
text
lists
blockquotes
inline-code
codeblocks
custom elements

Mdx is easy to write in and makes sure that the content is always styled well 
and fits the coding experience / expectations


<Editor 
code={code} 
tests={tests}
/>
