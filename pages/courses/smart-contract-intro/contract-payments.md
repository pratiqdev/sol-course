# Contract Payments

Now the next couple of things to do is to be able to make our vending machine 
accept payment, store it and put the item in the buyers inventory.

Letâ€™s start with the payment. To do this we can introduce a mapping. A Mapping 
in Solidity acts like a hash table or dictionary in any other language. These 
are used to store the data in the form of key-value pairs. Most commonly it is 
used to assign unique addresses with certain value types. It is like a phone 
book, we look up the name and it has a phone number assigned to it. 

We can define a mapping using the mapping keyword, as such

mapping (string => address) nameToAddress; // if we want to assign different 
strings an address (0xaddress)

mapping (uint => string) phoneNumberToName; // if we want to assign names to 
different numbers

In our instance we want to be able to load up the vending machine with money 
and associate the amount loaded into the machine with the user who paid. Since 
we are using Ethereum we know that the user will have a unique address so we 
can store the balances according to their address.

This would be an example of a mapping that maps addresses to integers.


Go ahead and add a public mapping called balances.

<!--
Code Editor Test: 
mapping (address => uint) public balances;
-->

Now we can add a function to add money to the vending machine

```
function addMoney (uint _amount) public payable {


}
```

Now note this function is payable. Any function in Solidity with the modifier 
Payable ensures that the function can send and receive Ether. It can process 
transactions with non-zero Ether values and rejects any transactions with a 
zero Ether value.
