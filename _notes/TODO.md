## Auto detect categoryIndex, categoryUri, courseUri

split and parse the route for the current category and course.
This can be used to highlight the nav menu section and page.
It can also remove the need for passing courseUri and categoryUri as props







## Question validation and feedback setup

- setup q&a validation
- show feedback on incorrect answers (after submission)
- tally and display score
- store answers in mongo (on submission)
- fetch answers from mongo (if already submitted)
- disable submit button if submitted already and no new changes to save
